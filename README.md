# Four in a Row Game Development in MIPS Assembly

## Summary

For my Computer Architecture course at Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, I developed a text-based Four in a Row game using MIPS assembly language. This project provided hands-on experience in low-level programming and reinforced my understanding of computer architecture concepts. Working individually, my key responsibilities included:

- **Game Logic Implementation**: Designed and implemented the core game logic, including player moves, undo functionality, and win condition checks.
- **User Interface Development**: Utilized the Bitmap Display Tool to create a friendly and intuitive text-based interface for the game.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented exception handling for invalid moves and provided a limited undo functionality for players.
- **Technical Documentation**: Authored detailed technical documentation to explain the game's implementation, including pseudocode for key functions and rules.

## Technologies Used

- MIPS Assembly Language
- Bitmap Display Tool

## Project Highlights

- **Core Game Logic**: Developed algorithms to handle player moves, check for winning conditions, and manage the game state.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Created a visual representation of the game board using Bitmap Display, enhancing the player experience.
- **Error and Undo Handling**: Implemented robust error handling and allowed players to undo moves, adding depth to the gameplay.

This project significantly enhanced my skills in assembly language programming, low-level hardware interaction, and algorithm development.
